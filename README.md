# TLK Localisation Tool
Tool that helps with SW KOTOR localisation.

## Features
1. View and edit .tlk files.
2. Get context for any particular .tlk entry by viewing files, in which it's used.

## Prerequisites
1. [Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0) and install .NET 8 runtime for Windows.
2. If you need 'Context' feture, extract game files from SW KOTOR .bif and .rim files to one folder. You can use [KOTOR Tool](https://deadlystream.com/files/file/280-kotor-tool/) for that.
3. Make a copy of dialog.tlk file, which will contain localised text.
